      <CENTER><h1><i>Introduction</i></h1></CENTER>
       <P><h3>Before Discussing about Coronavirus we need to know that What really viruses are.
       The Viruses are the microscopic parasites, and are generally smaller than Bacteria.
       They are smallest microbes ranging from 0.015 micrometer to 0.2 micrometer in size.
       Viruses are obligate parasites that are neither considered living nor as dead.
       They can only reproduce and grow inside the host cell and do not show any sign of life
       outside the cell. They are inactive outside the host cell but once they enter inside they
       multiply very fast and sometimes kills. the host cell.</P></h3>
     <CENTER><img src = "C:\Users\engga\Pictures\COvid.jfif"></CENTER> 
      

       <CENTER><h1><i>Structure Of a Virus</i></h1></CENTER>
       <P><h3>Viruses do not have any cell wall , cell membrane, nucleus and other cell organelles.
           They consist of a strand of nucleic acid either DNA or RNA (any given viruses can only have one or other), and this
           is surrounded by a protective layer of protien coat called as <b>capsid</b>. Few times they have a membrane of liquid
           that is reffered to as an <b>envelope</b> that surrounds the protein. The virus are not able to reproduce itself outside the 
           host cell as because it lacks the machinery that a host cell posseses. Hence, the host cellular machinery allows viruses to
           produce RNA from the host's DNA and this process is called as <b>transcription</b>, and to build proteins based on the instruction 
           encoded in their RNA and this process is known as <b>translation</b>.</h3>
</P><P><h3>
           The DNA or RNA found in the core of virus can be single stranded or double stranded.It consistituts the genome or the sum total of a viruses genetic 
           information. Viral genomes are generally small in size, and have only essential proteins such as capsid proteins, enzymes and proteins necessary for reproduction
           in host cell.</h3>
           <CENTER><img src="C:\Users\engga\Pictures\Structure of a Bacteriophages.jpg"></CENTER>
 </P>
  <CENTER><h1><i>Functions of Viruses in Host Cell</i></h1></CENTER>
  <P><h3>
      The common role of the viruses is to deliever its DNA or RNA genome into the host cell so that 
      the genome can be expressed (transcribed and translated) by the host cell. 

  </P><P>Viruses first needs to access the inside of a host's body.  Respiratory passages and open wounds
      are the best ways for viruses to enter the host body. Sometimes insects provide the mode of entry of the viruse to host cell.
      Certain viruses , hitch a ride in insect;s saliva and enter the host's body after insect bites.
      And this viruses can replicate in insect as well as host cell also. For Example:- the virus caused by <i>Dengue Fever</i>, in Dengue virus
      enter's the body of Female aedes mosquito which helps to enter the host cell when mosquito bite occurs. 


  </P>
  <P>
      Viruses wil then attach themselves to host cell surfaces with the help of tail fibres. After a virus binds to the surface of the host cell, it can start to move across the membrane of the host Cell.
     Once the viruses are inside, they release their genomes and also disrupt various parts of the cellular machinery. 
     Viral genomes direct host cells to ultimately produce vital proteins. Nextly, viruses sack the deck in their favor, both inside the host cell and within the host itself they create
     some conditions that allow them to spread the virus. For example in Covid -19 when the infected person will sneeze or coughs thousands of droplets will come out of his body. And if any other healthy person touches 
     or breaths those droplets this results the spread of the disease.</h3>

  <CENTER><h1><i>What is Coronavirus?</i></h1></CENTER>
 <P><h3>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness in humans and animals. There are 
   seven different types have been found in people, including those responsible for the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 epidemics.
   Early reports suggest the new virus is more contagious(means  that you can get by touching somebody/something) than the one causing SARS but less likely to cause severe symptoms.
  </h3> <CENTER><image src="C:\Users\engga\Pictures\Covid 19 image.jpg"></CENTER>
</P>
<CENTER><h1><i>What are the types of Coronavirus?</i></h1></CENTER>
<P><h3>
 There are four main types of coronaviruses that are known as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and delta. 
 <P><i>Alpha Coronavirus :</i>They are positive - sense, single stranded RNA viruses that infect mamals including humans. They have spherical virions with club- shaped surface projections formed by trimers of the spike protein, and a viral enevelope.
 </P>
 <P> <i>Beta Coronavirus :</i>They are viruses that infect mammals including humans. The natural reservoir(means the population of organisms or the specific environment in hich an infectious pathogen naturally lives and reproduces, or upon which pathogen primarily depends for its survival) for beta coronaviruses are bats and rodents. Here Rodents are the reservoir for subgenus <b>Embecovirus</b>, while bats are reservior for the other subgenera.
 </P><P> <i>Gamma Coronavirus :</i>They are in subfamily <b>Orthocoronavirinae</b> of the family <b>Coronaviridae</b>. 
  They are enveloped, positive - sense, single stranded RNA viruses of zoonotic orgin. This type of coronavirus infect both animals and humans. Gamma CoV is also known as <b>coronavirus group 3</b>
</P>
<P><i>Delta Coronavirus:</i>The Delta variant is  a variant of <b>SARS-CoV-2</b>, the virus that causes COVID-19. It was first detected in India in late 2020. The Delta variant was named on 31 May 2021 and had spread over 163 countries by 24 August 20201. The WHO indicated that the Delta variant is becoming dominant strain globally.</P>

</h3></P>
<CENTER><h1><i>What is the structure of Coronavirus</i></h1></CENTER>
<P><h3>Coronaviruses are relatively simple structures, and their form helps us to understand how they work. They are spherical coated with spikes of protein. These spikes help the virus bind to and infect healthy cells.</h3></P>
<P><h3>However, the same spikes are also what allows the immune system to see the virus. Bits of spike can be used in <b>potential coronavirus vaccines</b> to prompt the body to produce antibodies against the new virus.</h3></P>
<P><h3>They are named for the distinctive appearance of their spikes; when seen under a electron microscope, the spikes looks like a crown. And beneath these spikes is a layer of membrane. This membrane can be disrupted by handsoaps and alchohols, and that's why it said to wash always your hand, or sanitize it with alchohol based hand sanitizer and its effective against the virus.</h3></P>
<P><h3>Inside the membrane is the virus genetic material-it is called genome. Whereas the genome of some viruses like chickenpox are made of DNA like humans, those cornaviruses are made of the closely related RNA. RNA viruses have small genomes which are subject to constant change.</h3></P>

  <CENTER><h1><i>How Corona Virus is affecting human life from Past 2 years</i></h1></CENTER>
  <P><h3>COVID 19 has affected day to day life and is slowing down the global economy. This pandemic has affected thousands of peoples, who are either sick or are being killed due to the spread of this disease.This disease was first found in the continent of China in the city of Wuhan at December 2019. Then it spread all over the world and came to India in the month of February-March of 2020. The most common symptoms of this virus is fever, cold, cough, bone pain and breathing problems, and ultimately leading to pneumonia. This, being a new viral disease affecting humans for first time, but vaccines are now available all ove the world. But,  we should take all the precautions such as extensive hygiene protocol(for ex:- washing our hands with soap, avoidance of face to face interaction,following social distancing, and wearing masks and so on. </h3></P>

    <P><CENTER><h1><i>PANDEMIC vs EPIDEMIC</i></h1></CENTER></P>
    <P><h3> According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic is that:</h3></P>
    <P><h3><ul>1. <b><i><u>Epidemic</u></i> </b>: Epidemic is a sudden outbreak of a disease in a certain geographical area. </ul></h3></P>
   <P><h3><ul>2. <b><i><u>Pandemic</u></i> </b>: Pandemic is an outbreak of a disease that has spread across several countries or continents. It is basically an epidemic that has spread internationally and covers a wider geographic area. </ul></h3></P>
<CENTER><img src = "C:\Users\engga\Pictures\Pandemic vs Epidemic.png"></CENTER>
   <CENTER>
  <P><P><h1><i>How does and Epidemic occurs?</i></h1></P></P>
</CENTER> 
<P><h3>An epidemic can occur when:

 <ul>1. Infectious organisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.) suddenly become more prevalent in a particular area where it already existed.</ul>
  <ul>2. There is an outbreak of a disease in an area where it previously did not exist.</ul>
 <ul>3. People who weren’t previously susceptible to an infectious agent suddenly start getting sick from it.</ul> </h3></P>
 <CENTER><img src= "C:\Users\engga\Pictures\Epidemic.jpg"></CENTER>
 <CENTER><P><h1><i>Examples of Epidemic</i></h1></P></CENTER>
 <P><h3> Examples of Epidemic includes:-
   <ul>1. Smallpox</ul>
   <ul>2. Cholera</ul>
   <ul>3. Dengue Fever</ul>
   <ul>4. Typhoid</ul>
   <ul>5. Measles</ul>
   <ul>6. Polio</ul>
   <ul>7. Human immunodeficiency virus</ul>
 </h3></P>
 <CENTER><h1><i>What are 6 Phases of pandemic?</i></h1></CENTER>
 <P><h3>All pandemics begin as a localized disease outbreak or an epidemic that then begins spreading rapidly and eventually affects most of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes six phases of the development of a pandemic:</h3></P>
 <h3><ul>1. A pathogen (disease-causing organism) begins to circulate among animals that may or may not be known to spread the disease to humans.</ul>
 <ul>2. The pathogen is detected in animals.</ul>
 <ul>3. The disease begins to develop as there is animal-to-human contact.</ul>
 <ul>4. Human-to-human contact leads to the risk of a community outbreak.</ul>
 <ul>5. Human-to-human spread of the pathogen occurs in at least two countries in the same region.</ul>
 <ul>6. Community-level outbreaks occur in a third country in a different region. This phase indicates that a pandemic is occurring.</ul>

<P><h3>
 Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear two to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. You can still spread COVID-19 before you have symptoms, called presymptomatic. Common signs and symptoms can include:
 <ul>1. Cough</ul>
 <ul>2. Fever</ul>
 <ul>3. Tiredness</ul>
 <p><h3>Early symptoms of Covid may include a loss of taste or smell.</h3></p>
 <p><h3>Other symptoms can include:</h2></p>
 <ul><h3>1. Shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing</h3></ul>
 <ul><h3>2. Muscles aches</h3></ul>

  <P><h3>Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, 
    ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and 
    avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.</h3></P>
    <P><h3>Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands
       with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.</h3></P>

  Japan there are many more countries which are least affected by COVID-19. Countries like :- Singapore, Micronesia, Saint Helen, Samoa, Belize, Haiti etc, are least affected by COVID with less deaths.
and this is because of the strict rules and precautions taken by the people of the country. For example in Singapore the wearing of mask was mandatory.
And all the precautions were taken seriously. And that resulted Singapore a success of getting very less amount of deaths that is only 233. </h3></P>

<P><CENTER><h1><i>What Precautions Should be taken to the recently recovered Covid survivor</i></h1></CENTER></P>
<P><h3>It has been a while now since the COVID-19 pandemic, and people are slowly learning of many different ways to deal with it — both in terms of recovery and prevention. It is a known fact that the virus, once it is inside the body, does not
   isolate and attack the respiratory system alone, but instead makes its way to many other organs.</h3></P>
 
   <P><h3>Dr Md Shakeel, Head-Emergency & Trauma, Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi — a Fortis Network Hospital — says a study conducted in Italy showed that 87.4 per cent of patients, who had recovered from COVID-19, reportedly felt some kind of fatigue and dyspnoea (laboured breathing). This was reported even after two months of being discharged from the hospital.</h3></P>
<P><h3>Some patients who had recovered had to be rushed back with low oxygen saturation levels, just a day after discharge. These patients were admitted to the hospital for at least 10 more days, and were discharged only after they started doing well. These patients returned to the hospital with a whole spectrum of lung diseases – from fibrosis (formation of hard fibrous tissues as the lung heals from an injury) to secondary infections and pneumonia. It was also noted that after recovering from COVID-19, some patients came back with reduced heart function, heart attack or even stroke</h3></P>
<P><h3>The doctor says that there are some things that COVID survivors should assess:

<P> <ul> * Their daily check of oxygen saturation, it should be maintained at >94% in room air.</ul></P>
 <P><ul> * They must watch for respiratory symptoms like persistence or worsening of cough and breathlessness.</ul></P>
<P><ul> * Check for persistent rise of body temperature above 100F.</ul></P> 
 <P><ul>* Watch out for signs of lethargy, drowsiness, and altered sensorium.</ul></P> 
<P><ul> * Regular monitoring of blood sugar in known diabetic patients. COVID infection (as any other infection) alters blood sugar levels of the body. Strict monitoring once in three days and regular consultation with your doctor is required.</P> </ul>
<P><ul> * Regular blood pressure monitoring in known hypertensive patients is required to avoid accelerated hypertension-related complications. Weekly blood pressure monitoring in case of controlled hypertension, or more frequently in case of abnormal readings, is required.</P> </ul> 
 <P><ul> * Follow up consultation with the doctor within seven days of discharge.</ul></P> 
 <P><ul> * Blood investigations like CBC, CRP at first follow up, and subsequent follow-ups, if advised by a physician. </ul></P> 
 <P><ul> * Repeat CT scan of chest after three months to look at the extent of lung recovery post-infection.</ul></P> </h2></P>
<P><h3>And these Precautions should must be taken to remove the virus completely from your Body!</h3></P>

<CENTER><P><h1><i>What is Mutation?</i></h1></P></CENTER>
<P><h3><b>Mutation</b> is defined as the probability that a change in genetic information is 
  passed to the next generation. Viruses that encode their genome in RNA, such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV and influenza, tend to pick up mutations quickly as they
   are copied inside their hosts, because enzymes that copy RNA are prone to making errors. After the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus began 
   circulating in humans, for instance, it developed a kind of mutation called a deletion that might have slowed its spread.  </h3></P>
   <P><h3>But sequencing data suggest that coronaviruses change more slowly than most other RNA viruses, probably because of a ‘proofreading’ enzyme that corrects potentially fatal copying mistakes. A typical SARS-CoV-2 virus accumulates only two single-letter mutations per month in its genome — a rate of change about half that of influenza and one-quarter that of HIV, says Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Basel, Switzerland.</h3></P>
   <P><h3>Despite the virus’s sluggish mutation rate, researchers have catalogued more than 12,000 mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. But scientists can spot mutations faster than they can make sense of them. Many mutations will have no consequence for the virus’s ability to spread or cause disease, because they do not alter the shape of a protein, whereas those mutations that do change proteins are more likely to harm the virus than improve it (see ‘A catalogue of coronavirus mutations’).</h3></P>
 <P><h3>Many researchers suspect that if a mutation did help the virus to spread faster, it probably happened earlier, when the virus first jumped into humans or acquired the ability to move efficiently from one person to another. At a time when nearly everyone on the planet is susceptible(easily influenced, damaged or affected by somebody/something), there is likely to be little evolutionary pressure on the virus to spread better, so even potentially beneficial mutations might not flourish.</h3></P>
  <P><h3>Current measures to reduce these steps of mutation is to follow all the precautions given by the Government. And for the people above 18 years its mandatory to be vaccinated.</h3></P>

 <CENTER><h1><i>3 ways to prepare ourselves for the next Pandemic</i></h1></CENTER>
 <CENTER><img src = "C:\Users\engga\Pictures\Next pandemic.jfif"></CENTER>
 <P><h3><ul><P><h2>1. Reduce deforestation </h2></P>
  Over the past century, two new animal-borne viruses have emerged from nature every year — and these numbers are expected to skyrocket over the next decade. 
  
  According to experts, deforestation is largely to blame.
  
  Research shows that land-use change — such as development or agricultural expansion — is the single largest driver of emerging disease. As humans encroach deeper into the undisturbed forest, they are also exposing themselves to animals and the diseases they carry — a process known as “virus spillover,” Hannah explained. 
  
  “Whether it is someone hunting for bushmeat or shopping at a wild animal and fish market, virus spillover can happen any place where there is wildlife, especially in the tropics,” Hannah said. “The risk becomes even higher when countries cut down forests to make room for roads, agriculture or infrastructure because they are also creating new edges of the forest — which can increase exposure to animals with diseases that can infect humans.”
  
  Reports show that deforestation climbed by 3 percent in 2019 — with the planet losing a soccer-field sized chunk of tropical forest every six seconds. 
  
  But not all hope is lost — if countries invest in strategies to dramatically decrease deforestation, Roehrdanz says.
  
  “Just 10 percent of tropical forests hold more than half of the global risk for zoonotic disease emergence or ‘spillover’ from animals to humans,” Roehrdanz explained.  “An upfront investment in reducing tropical deforestation now could save us billions of dollars down the line by preventing the next pandemic.”
  
  The new study concludes that investments between US$ 1.5 billion and US$ 9.6 billion could decrease deforestation at a rate that would reduce the risk of forest loss-related disease spillover by 40 percent in high-risk areas. The strategies will to reduce deforestation vary by country based on political, economic and environmental factors. 
  
  "Decreasing deforestation does not have to come at the cost of economic growth,” Hannah explained. “In fact, implementing sustainable strategies — such as getting rid of agricultural subsidies that support the widespread clearing of land — could actually save countries money.” “Not only is this good for public health, it will help slow climate change.”  
</ul>
<ul><P><h2>2. Limit the global wildlife trade </h2></P>
  Described by many scientists as “hotbeds of disease,” markets that sell wild animals have likely been the origin of several zoonotic illnesses, including COVID-19 and the 2003 SARS outbreak. 
  
  But these markets are just the tip of a (multi-billion-dollar) iceberg: the global wildlife trade. 
  
  Driven by demand for wild animal delicacies or the exotic pet industry, the global wildlife trade generates US$ 23 billion every year. But these indulgences come at a cost to public health, Ahumada explained.
  
  “The wild animal trade puts species in contact with other species — and other diseases — that they likely would have never encountered naturally in the wild. 
  
  “As soon as these animals are traded internationally, the risk of a small zoonotic disease outbreak turning into a full-blown pandemic suddenly increases exponentially.”
  
  According the new study, the first step to preventing this is by banning the national and international trade of species that have a high risk of spreading disease, such as bats and pangolins. </ul>

  <ul><P><h2>3. Increase early virus detection</h2></P>
    On December 31, 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Wuhan, China. However, recent research revealed that the virus had already been raging through the city undetected since November, triggering a pandemic that would soon spread to every corner of the world. 
    
    According to Hannah, the key to preventing these silent outbreaks is investing in research programs to detect disease spread at its source as soon as it arises. 
    
    “There is a significant underreporting of human exposure to zoonotic diseases around the world,” Hannah said. “We need to actively track and stop virus spillover in areas where people are in high contact with wildlife, including farms and ranches, because zoonotic diseases such as swine flu and bird flu can emerge from human-livestock contact.”
    
    Organizations such as the EcoHealth Alliance are already running programs to monitor zoonotic diseases, but are unable to expand surveillance at a global scale due to limited funding. The report found that an investment of at least US$ 1.5 million per agency would offer a significant return on disease prevention. 
    
    “By identifying the regions that are most vulnerable to virus spillover, countries can also target the communities that stand to benefit the most disease prevention strategies, including protective gear to prevent human-livestock contact, effective sanitation infrastructure and education programs,” Hannah said.
    
    “The fact of the matter is, the most cost-effective — and just plain effective — way to deal with a pandemic is to make sure it never happens in the first place."</ul>
</h3></P>
<CENTER><h1><i>Conclusion</i></h1></CENTER>
<P><h2>COVID-19 is the worst pandemic in the history of viruses and this virus has taken millions of deaths around the world. But now in 2021 vaccines are made to protect us from this virus.
  But this doesn't means that we don't have to follow precautions. We have to follow all the precautions seriously even though we are vaccinated. We have to see the positive side that this virus will be go soon from the world. I conclude here.
